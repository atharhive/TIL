        go out and understand even if it is not aesthetically pleasing,<br>
        read ebooks on your phone, learn languages that some seem to deem irrelevant,<br>
        study a field people tell you is useless, take ugly notes, curse when you explain concepts<br>
        back to yourself, study sitting at the kitchen table, make wonky flashcards,<br>
        read things that interest you, eat takeout between study sessions,<br>
        wear sneakers instead of oxfords, sweatpants when you're sitting on the library floor,<br>
        draw diagrams in cheap ballpoint pen, learn 'imperfectly'<br><br>
        it never matters like that.

# 🌱 TIL — A Quiet Archive

I’m not here to teach you.  
I’m not here to impress you.

This is a quiet archive of things I’ve learned, things I’ve failed at, things I’m still trying to understand.  
It’s my **digital footprint** — written not for the world, but for awareness, for memory, for peace.

If you’re reading this, welcome.  
You’ve found the notebook of a wandering learner.

## 📘 What You'll Find Here

- 📅 A slow TIL log — Today I Learned  
- 🧠 Notes from books, courses, and passing thoughts  
- 💭 Journals and reflections — raw and unfiltered  
- 💡 Dreams, ideas, and unfinished sketches  
- 💻 Tiny code experiments and curious hacks  
- 🔧 How-to guides and resources that helped me  

This is not a blog. It’s not a tutorial site.

It’s a **digital attic** where thoughts are kept safe.  
Some of it may help you.  
All of it is helping me.
