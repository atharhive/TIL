        back to yourself, study sitting at the kitchen table, make wonky flashcards,<br>
        read things that interest you, eat takeout between study sessions,<br>
        wear sneakers instead of oxfords, sweatpants when you're sitting on the library floor,<br>
        draw diagrams in cheap ballpoint pen, learn 'imperfectly'<br><br>
        it never matters like that.

# 🌱 TIL — A Quiet Archive

I’m not here to teach you.  
I’m not here to impress you.

This is a quiet archive of things I’ve learned, things I’ve failed at, things I’m still trying to understand.  
It’s my **digital footprint** — written not for the world, but for awareness, for memory, for peace.

If you’re reading this, welcome.  
You’ve found the notebook of a wandering learner.
