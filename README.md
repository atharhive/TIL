  go out and understand even if it is not <br>
  aesthetically pleasing, read ebooks on your <br>
  phone, learn languages that some seem to deem <br>
  irrelevant, study a field people tell you is useless <br>
  take ugly notes, curse when you explain concepts <br>
  back to yourself, study sitting at the kitchen table, <br>
  make wonky flashcards, read things that interest <br>
  you, eat takeout between study sessions, wear <br>
  sneakers instead of oxfords, sweatpants when <br>
  you're sitting on the library floor, draw diagrams in <br>
  cheap ballpoint pen, learn 'imperfectly' <br><br>
  it never matters like that.

# 🌱 TIL — A Quiet Archive

I’m not here to teach you.  
I’m not here to impress you.

This is a quiet archive of things I’ve learned, things I’ve failed at, things I’m still trying to understand.  
It’s my **digital footprint** — written not for the world, but for awareness, for memory, for peace.

If you’re reading this, welcome.  
You’ve found the notebook of a wandering learner.

## 📘 What You'll Find Here

- 📅 A slow TIL log — Today I Learned

- 💭 Journals and reflections — raw and unfiltered  
- 💡 Dreams, ideas, and unfinished sketches

It’s a **digital attic** where thoughts are kept safe.  
Some of it may help you.  
All of it is helping me.
